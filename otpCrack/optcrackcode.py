#the print of the previous method 
#So i change the key to strxor(cp[4], "When ") and proceed
#from here on, the procedure is the same, 
#for example the third index, starts with "Nobod", and I
#can assume that it starts with "Nobody" and a 
#whitespace (as seen from the previous method also the #length matches)

#From here on, the procedure remains the same, I keep 
#changing the key, and look to expand the key more and

#strxor(cp[9],"We have young kids who often walk into #our room at night for various reasons including #clowning ")

#9th sentence, this finishes the excercise.
